## ðŸ’¡ About

This project compiles a list of common computer science algorithms, demonstrating their implementation in a range of modern programming languages. Currently, the following languages are supported:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Cloning

To clone this repository, run the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ollyrowe/algorithms.git
```

To contribute to this project, you must first make a fork of the repository and then clone the fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/algorithms.git
```

### Installation

After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Algorithms

All resources held within this project can be seen from the [website](https://ollyrowe.github.io/algorithms/). This site hosts an up-to-date view of all algorithms, data structures and additional general resources held within this repository.

### Website

The website is built with the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework with support from the [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) component library.

The relevant steps to setting up and configuring the development environnement for the website can be seen below.

#### Development

The source code for the website can be found within the `./website` folder of this repository.

After cloning the repository, step into the website directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd website
npm install
```

To run the local development environment, the following command can be used.

```bash
npm run serve
```

To re-compile the website's content, the following command can be ran.

```bash
npm run compile-content
```

> Note that this command is automatically ran when running `npm run serve`

This command parses the resources held within the root directories of this repository to a JSON file which is then read by the hosted site. Currently, this script accounts for the following folders and file signatures which supports resource folders and a set of files for each language implementation in addition to a general information file.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ algorithms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <resource>
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <resource>-info.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <resource>.cs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <resource>.java
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <resource>.js
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <resource>.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <resource>.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ data-structures
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ general
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

#### Linting

The development environnement requires the installation of both [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). If you are using Visual Studio Code, the supporting extensions should also be installed and configured.

To lint and fix files from the command line, the following command can be used.

```bash
npm run lint
```

#### Build

A production build of the website can be compiled with the following command.

```bash
npm run build
```

#### CI / CD

This project makes use of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to enable continuous integration and deployment of new features into the master branch which is automatically deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
